    <h1>Hardship:</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        Breath shortens, eyes dilate, and pulse quickens.<br>
        Thoughts speed by blurring together until they are silent.<br>
        A moment of calm, The world waits, and there, in the quiet,<br>
        Sweat drips.<br>
        It seems impossible, the trial is too hard<br>
        The hill too steep, the fear too complete.<br>
        Every step is agony and every breath is a gift to cherish.<br>
        <br>
        Time lengthens, muscles tense, and sound fades.<br>
        Thoughts fade behind reflex until instinct is the only guide.<br>
        A moment of fury, the world gasps, and there, in the frenzy<br>
        Blood drips. <br>
        It seems impossible the pain is too great<br>
        The rocks too sharp the weakness too complete.<br>
        Every breath is agony and every feeling a gift to cherish<br>
        <br>
        Space tilts, breath catches, pain rages.<br>
        Thoughts slow and come into focus until reality returns.<br>
        A moment of fear, the world laughs and there, in the pain,<br>
        Tears drip.<br>
        It seemed too impossible, the trial was too hard.<br>
        The rocks too steep, but now it is complete<br>
        Every feeling is agony, and life a gift to cherish<br>
