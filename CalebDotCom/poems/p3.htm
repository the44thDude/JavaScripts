        He knows where to aim. <br>
        It's not at the head, the best way to someone's soul isn't through their logic, reason, or mind.<br>
        He knows where to aim.<br>
        It's not at the hands, the best way to someone's soul isn't through their actions, habits, or craft.<br>
        He knows where to aim.<br>
        It's not at the loins, the best way to someone's soul isn't through their hunger, desire, or lust.<br>
        He knows where to aim.<br>
        That's why they call him the deadliest sin.<br>
        He knows where to aim.<br>
        It's not at someone's head or lust, loins or craft, hands, or mind. <br>
        He knows where to aim. <br>
        He knows precisely where to pinpoint his target to fire his twin weapons, "self-loathing" in his left hand hurling the bullet of false humility, and comfort in his right blowing the gunpowder of self-love.<br>
        He knows where to aim.<br>
        3 centimeters up from the sternum and 3 to the left.<br>
        He knows where to aim.<br>
        For every man, woman, and child, he knows if it's higher, further to the left, or maybe even reflected across on the right side, no matter where it is he can find it and know it and hit it. He knows all his prey the same.<br>
        He knows his target's heart.<br>
        Pride knows where to aim.<br>
        Pride knows from the start.<br>
