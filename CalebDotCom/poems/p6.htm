    <h1>End.</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        Try your best they say <br>
        Don't give up, <br>
        Don't go the wrong way.<br>
        They tell you to never stop<br>
        Chase your dreams<br>
        And make it to the top<br>
        And yet what the say isn't right<br>
        They'll tell you not to fight.<br>
        But battle you must <br>
        because there's no one to trust.<br>
        Don't stop.<br>
        Don't give up.<br>
        Don't finish with that.<br>
        But when it's over <br>
        And all said and done<br>
        The truth is no body's won.<br>
        We are blown by the winds. <br>
        We try to keep going<br>
        And yet it ends.<br>
        We try to hold on to every moment.<br>
        We try to never let go.<br>
        We try to never move on.<br>
        But eventually it's gone.<br>
        We try to pretend.<br>
        And yet it must end.<br>

    </p>
