    <h1>Without God
    </h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        We all have cracks, fissures in our souls,<br>
        Where pain’s left tracks, and burned us full of holes.<br>
        <br>
        Look around it's true<br>
        There's sin in all we do<br>
        We can't save one soul<br>
        All are broken, none are whole<br>
        <br>
        Some fall into pieces, when the pain's too much to bear <br>
        Our hope in life ceases, and our souls begin to tear.<br>
        <br>
        Look around it's true<br>
        There's sin in all we do<br>
        We can't save one soul<br>
        All are broken, none are whole.<br>
        <br>
        When you can't stand it’s cruel, life doesn't cease it's hits<br>
        Life picks up it's wicked tool, and shatters us to bits.<br>
        <br>
        Look around it's true<br>
        There's sin in all we do<br>
        We can't save one soul<br>
        All are broken, none are whole<br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p></p>
