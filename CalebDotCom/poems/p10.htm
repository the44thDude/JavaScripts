    <h1>His.</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        I don't belong here<br>
        And that isn't fear<br>
        This isn't my place.<br>
        The steps that I trace.<br>
        The paths that I walk<br>
        The words that I talk<br>
        Even the things that I know<br>
        Are not where I go.<br>
        I know where I belong<br>
        Because when I am wrong<br>
        When can't even crawl<br>
        He is my all<br>
        When I'm ashamed of what I have done<br>
        He stands up and shouts: “he is my son!”<br>
        When I am broken, pained<br>
        When my soul has been stained<br>
        When I give in to the wild<br>
        He says “I love you, my child”<br>
        In my sin<br>
        he steps in<br>
        And he stays.<br>
        All of my days<br>
        He casts out all my fears<br>
        He wipes off all my tears<br>
        And speaks in my ear<br>
        “You don't belong here”<br>
