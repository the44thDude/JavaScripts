        "New year new me"<br>
        Except not. You see.<br>
        You're the same person<br>
        No part of you's gone<br>
        But you have new chances<br>
        To make new life advances<br>
        Now is as good a time as any<br>
        Your nickel can become a penny<br>
        But it won't be simple<br>
        It won't be easy.<br>
        It takes effort.<br>
        And it will get harder.<br>
        You will go through a crucible.<br>
        You will go through the valley of shadow<br>
        You will go through times without motivation<br>
        But now is as good a time as any.<br>
        Go make yourself one in many.<br>
        This isn't a rearrange.<br>
        This is true full change<br>
        Your only restraint is wits<br>
        New year, new limits<br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p></p>
