    <h1>The View from Here</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>

        I stand atop a peak where I can see my past<br>
        I’ve walked till I was weak, and tried to go fast<br>
        I look back on my journey and think through my trail.<br>
        I’ve done much learning I learn whenever I fail. <br>
        <br>
        There have been valleys, it has been hard. <br>
        There have been rocks, it has been slow.<br>
        what would mountains be without valleys? What is darkness without light?<br>
        Life would have no color, and the views wouldn't be worth the height. <br>
        <br>
        I think of the forks, the times I chose wrong.<br>
        I relied on my own works and didn’t last long.<br>
        I took paths of darkness, and had to be lead to light<br>
        I often felt helpless and was made to stand and fight <br>
        <br>
        There have been hopes it has been fun.<br>
        There have been views it has been pretty.<br>
        Where will I go? What awaits me?<br>
        The only way to know is to walk on and see. <br>
        <br>
        
    </p>
