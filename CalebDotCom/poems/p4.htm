    <h1>Do as We are Told:</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        Do as we are told. Do as we must <br>
        We have to listen even without trust.<br>
        We must blindly step and follow the path <br>
        Or face what might happen, the aftermath<br>
        We are destined to repeat and destined to follow in the footsteps and footfalls of those who went before us. Destined to mirror and mimic the prints in the dust to pursue what we must.<br>
        We are destined to do what the world would have us. Destined to pursue even if our minds are against it. <br>
        Or at least we have to seem as we are. Act so that the voice speaking out and fish going upstream isn't noticed. or the crowd would crush it under the pretense of safety.<br>
        We are destined to act in the way we are told<br>
        From when we are young to when we grow old<br>
        From this fate we cannot defend<br>
        Because we are fated to pretend.<br>
