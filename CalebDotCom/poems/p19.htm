    <h1>Sounds in the dark</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        I remember two gates<br>
        One was wide and clear.<br>
        The path was flat.<br>
        And the destination near.<br>
        The other I almost missed.<br>
        It was small and narrow<br>
        And the path did duck and twist<br>
        <br>
        Now it’s an echo, one of many bouncing and spinning all around<br>
        In the darkness and pain all I hear are echoes, echoes are the only sound.<br>
        <br>
        I remember being led <br>
        Called and guided I was pulled.<br>
        I joined the flock and was loved<br>
        And when I strayed, he held me from the cold<br>
        He walked me and pushed me<br>
        I was tempted and he always welcomed me back <br>
        And in my fear,he shushed me. <br>
        <br>
        Now he is and echo, one of many bouncing and spinning all around<br>
        In the darkness and pain all I hear are echoes, echoes are the only sound.<br>
        <br>
        I remember a cross,<br>
        at the top of the Calvary hill<br>
        I asked him what it was for<br>
        And he said it was meant to kill<br>
        I shied in fear and to him looked<br>
        He smiled in kindness, nodded<br>
        And went up the hill to the cross and my place took.<br>
        <br>
        Now its and echo, one of many bouncing and spinning all around<br>
        In the darkness and pain all I hear are echoes, echoes are the only sound.<br>
        <br>
        I remember a woman<br>
        Her lips were honey<br>
        And her speech smooth as oil and<br>
        She led me to a path that was sunny.<br>
        But she soon grew bitter<br>
        The path wandered and wormwood grew and<br>
        Her face grew dull and lost its glitter.<br>
        <br>
        Now she is and echo, one of many bouncing and spinning all around<br>
        In the darkness and pain all I hear are echoes, echoes are the only sound.<br>
        <br>
        I remember a mountain’s path<br>
        On one side was a cliff<br>
        I tried to pass it quickly running<br>
        But the way was slick and my feet stiff<br>
        I didn’t slip, it was worse<br>
        My steps were wrong<br>
        And I flew off my course<br>
        <br>
        Now it’s an echo, one of many bouncing and spinning all around<br>
        In the darkness and pain all I hear are echoes, echoes are the only sound.<br>
        I cry out but hear only echoes<br>
        The sounds bounce back at me<br>
        The loneliness fills me<br>
        The darkness swallows me<br>
        The pain is all I feel<br>
        “Where are you?”<br>
        “Why have you forsaken me?”<br>
        I call out to you but all I hear are<br>
        Echoes<br>
        Echoes<br>
        Echoes<br>
        Echoes<br>
        Echoes<br>
        Echoes<br>
    </p>
    <p></p>
