    <h1>A world of sin</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        Something is wrong. <br>
        In this world, in this life<br>
        Yes there is love and beautiful sights<br>
        But there also is hate and quite a few fights<br>
        Wherever you walk<br>
        They whisper and talk<br>
        The liars and cheats<br>
        With dissonant beats<br>
        Or chords in their song<br>
        You can certainly tell that something is wrong<br>
        Something is wrong.<br>
        Or at least something's not right<br>
        Yes there are mountains of height<br>
        With sights to inspire<br>
        But lest we forget there also is fire<br>
        Nature is stunted and cursed with our construction <br>
        It is burned and broken by man made destruction <br>
        Wherever you look<br>
        For a peaceful nook<br>
        You can also hear<br>
        Pain, hurt and fear<br>
        With this in mind you can't go long<br>
        Ignoring the fact that something is wrong<br>
        Something is wrong<br>
        You can't go anywhere, steering <br>
        Through your life<br>
        Without seeing or hearing<br>
        Stories of strife<br>
        You can't look for the righteous<br>
        Or those who are good<br>
        Without finding the pious <br>
        Who hate more than they should<br>
        Wherever there's a lover, artist or friend maker<br>
        You'll also find haters, bigots and heart breakers<br>
        If you look at the crowds you will find<br>
        There are always predators in the throng<br>
        Waiting to hurt someone in a bind<br>
        And so you will see, Something is wrong.<br>
        Something is wrong<br>
        How can't you see?<br>
        that something is wrong<br>
        with you and with me<br>
        yes there is power in passion, love, and care but isn't it backwards.<br>
        that to have those first you must share? <br>
        Share your world<br>
        Share your heart<br>
        Share your soul<br>
        And when you share you forfeit control<br>
        You open yourself up to be broken and shattered<br>
        To be torn, to be mocked, beaten, and battered.<br>
        Because sometime your feelings have no weight<br>
        And when you give them to someone sometimes they hate.<br>
        There's no way to tell to know all along <br>
        If the one you love will do you wrong<br>
        And now I ask: <br>
        How can you look at how the weak are hurt by the strong<br>
        And not conclude that something is wrong?<br>
    </p>
