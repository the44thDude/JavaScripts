    <h1>The False Snake</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        It starts as a question: a simple thought or quick picture, a curve, stroke, or line that's missing, and it twists the drawing. <br>
        The line seems small. The curve, unimportant. And the stroke as fluid as when you first marked it. <br>
        You move on the next day: a simple trip, or quick misstep, a bearing, path, or line that's off, and it twists the journey.<br>
        The line seems fine. The bearing right enough. And The path as easy as when you first walked  it<br>
        It continues as questions: a simple word, or quick statement, a note, song or line that's off, and it twists the melody.<br>
        The line seems right. The note in harmony. <br>
        And the song as perfect as when you first sang it<br>
        You see it after a while: a simple truth, or a quick harness, a belay, knot or line that's off, and it twists the rope.<br>
        The line seems tight. The belay will support you.<br>
        And the knot is as secure as when you first climbed.<br>
        But.<br>
        But.<br>
        It was wrong. The question has no answer. The thought was far too complicated. The curves and strokes were the shapes that made art.<br>
        You shouldn't have kept going. The next day was worse. The trip was far too complicated. The bearing and path were what lead you away.<br>
        It was wrong. The questions kept coming. The word was far too complicated. The note and song were what made the melody.<br>
        You should have stopped, the new truth was far too complicated and full of lies. The knot and belay were what failed and let you fall.<br>
        It may start small but it ends too big to face and to high to conquer. <br>
        Your picture was false. Your missteps were false, your statement was false, and your harness was false. <br>
        Truth has no fruit with seeds of doubt. But every vine that grows around it bears fruit devoid of flesh. Filled with seeds that will catch in your throat.<br>
        The seeds will twist your rope<br>
        The seeds will twist your song<br>
        The seeds will twist your journey<br>
        The seeds will twist your picture.<br>
        But more than anything else in your youth<br>
        The seeds from vines of doubt twist the truth.<br>
