    <h1>Never fail</h1>

    <p>
        Too often we confuse power and strength.<br>
        For power you simply push up a hill<br>
        but true strength requires sacrifice of will<br>
        Power comes to those who don't deserve it,<br>
        Power can be used for yourself,<br>
        Power is selfish.<br>
        But<br>
        When you give everything and still offer more,<br>
        When you are willing to put aside yourself for them,<br>
        When you let them pull your soul along,<br>
        And Change your desire, then. You are strong.<br>
        <br>
        Too often we confuse fame and strength<br>
        Fame is just the expectation of praise<br>
        But true strength is respect of others ways.<br>
        Fame comes to those ruthless for themselves<br>
        Fame can be used to crush others<br>
        Fame has no master<br>
        But<br>
        When you give everything and still offer more,<br>
        When you are willing to put aside yourself for them,<br>
        When you let them sing their own song,<br>
        And are satisfied in silence, then you are strong.<br>
        <br>
        Too often we confuse arrogance with strength<br>
        Arrogance hears no kind correction<br>
        But true strength requires wise direction<br>
        Arrogance comes to those who are not true<br>
        Arrogance can be used to hold others down<br>
        Arrogance is built on lies<br>
        But<br>
        When you give everything and still offer more,<br>
        When you are willing to put aside yourself for them,<br>
        When you can admit that you are wrong<br>
        And listen to truth, then you are strong.<br>
        <br>
        Too often we confuse stoicism with strength<br>
        Stoicism feels nothing, and pushes away<br>
        But true strength feels more than just gray<br>
        Stoicism comes to those who ignore pain<br>
        Stoicism can be used to push others away<br>
        Stoicism is unstable<br>
        But<br>
        When you give everything and still offer more,<br>
        When you are willing to put aside yourself for them,<br>
        When you feel every emotion in the throng<br>
        And don't bottle pain, then you are strong.<br>
        <br>
        Strength is sacrifice<br>
        Strength is respect<br>
        Strength is humility<br>
        Strength is emotion<br>
        Strength shows kindness<br>
        Strength shows courage<br>
        Strength shows Truth<br>
        Strength is more than just the ability to lift.<br>
        Strength is more than just the ability to stand in fear<br>
        Strength is love. <br>
        And love never fails.<br>
        <br>
