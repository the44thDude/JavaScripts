    <h1>The Unicorn:</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        Look to the Unicorn<br>
        the ones in the corners<br>
        They don't blow their own horn <br>
        or look for adorners.<br>
        Learn from them<br>
        Watch them <br>
        Smile for them<br>
        And see them.<br>
        They're the unseen <br>
        They're hidden and shy<br>
        Yet they're the most keen<br>
        I don't know why<br>
        But next time you think you too cool<br>
        Full of self satisfaction. <br>
        Remember the person next to the pool<br>
        Reading to avoiding interaction<br>
        Note their wants, preference and view.<br>
        Because they've certainly noted those things for you <br>
        
    </p>
