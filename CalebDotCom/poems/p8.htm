    <h1>Unchained:</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        Freedom is strange,<br>
        It gives us range<br>
        To make life change,<br>
        And yet this treat<br>
        Is bittersweet. <br>
        We crave independence<br>
        Yet see no hindrance<br>
        To the way we relate<br>
        The power to change fate<br>
        To wipe clean a dirty slate<br>
        Gives us glee.<br>
        We are free<br>
        But the price for this<br>
        Is loneliness.<br>
        What's that worth?<br>
        We go forth, <br>
        From death to birth,<br>
        Don't look back,<br>
        On our track,<br>
        Make our own way,<br>
        But we don't stay,<br>
        And so we pay.<br>
        
        
    </p>
    <p></p>
