    <h1>Rain:</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        Dripping and dropping,<br>
        Cleaning and cleansing<br>
        Pooling and plopping<br>
        It falls. Wetting and washing<br>
        Washing the dirt<br>
        Washing the dust<br>
        Washing all the world of all the stuff<br>
        The stuff that was slung<br>
        And flung, plopping<br>
        And now the fish are happy<br>
        Swimming flipping and flopping<br>
        The cats are not happy <br>
        Hissing and straining <br>
        As though each drop is paining<br>
        My shoes are squelching<br>
        My feet are squeaking<br>
        And the water is draining <br>
        Oh joy, it must be raining <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p></p>
