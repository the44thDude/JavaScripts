    <h1>The hole inside.</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>

        This isn't how it's meant to be<br>
        This world and life are full of strife<br>
        And it seems to me <br>
        That's not how it's meant to be<br>
        We all fall short in his court<br>
        With filthy rags to report<br>
        We all have sin<br>
        That hides within<br>
        And we don't know <br>
        How deep it goes<br>
        We have no hope<br>
        Except to cope<br>
        With what we've done<br>
        And rest in his perfect son<br>
        His son will save us from the grave<br>
        With the gift he freely gave<br>
        In him we all depend<br>
        So Bless me father I have sinned<br>
        I threw my cares into the wind<br>
        I stopped to think about her face<br>
        And remembered how she needs her space<br>
        It seems that when I move to hide<br>
        Conceal from you what's inside<br>
        The hurt becomes an optic tide<br>
        It throws all my cares aside <br>
        And washes out upon my face<br>
        But my tears have left with no trace<br>
        Except they leave their crusted salt<br>
        To put in me the mark of fault<br>
        I need you now to bless my soul<br>
        So you can help me fill the hole<br>
        The chest cut wound split within<br>
        That let my heart fill with sin<br>
        But now is emptied out<br>
        By the words I shout<br>
        Leaving open the perfect place<br>
        An empty hollow aching space<br>
        To be filled by his unchanging grace<br>
        
        
    </p>
    <p></p>
