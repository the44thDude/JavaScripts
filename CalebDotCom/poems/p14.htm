    <h1>On a quiet path.</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        
        The forest is dark.<br>
        And sometimes it's cold.<br>
        There's decaying bark.<br>
        And trees that are old.<br>
        There's a soft snow.<br>
        And a dusting frost.<br>
        But the stream does flow.<br>
        And the stumps are mossed.<br>
        There's a chill in the air<br>
        And a leaves on the ground<br>
        And the sun has a glare<br>
        That shines all around.<br>
        There's sticks that are rotting<br>
        And mushrooms that grow<br>
        There's plants worth potting<br>
        And caws from a crow<br>
        There’s a nice shore<br>
        With lots of sand.<br>
        And ants that bore <br>
        And cross the land.<br>
        There’s a loud pecking<br>
        From somewhere ahead<br>
        where a bird is wrecking<br>
        A beetle's sweet bed.<br>
        There’s a dead tree <br>
        Collapsed in my path<br>
        Laid at an odd degree<br>
        As the wood turns to lath.<br>
        There's hints of green.<br>
        That poke through the brown.<br>
        They're barely seen.<br>
        When you look down.<br>
        Under the sweet wet brush.<br>
        And the carpeted mold.<br>
        The bugs scurry and rush.<br>
        As the worms turn and fold.<br>
        There's flowers that bloom<br>
        And herbs that smell<br>
        There's a odorous ploom<br>
        And fruit that does swell<br>
        There's a rustling breeze<br>
        That blows and gusts<br>
        It shakes through the trees<br>
        And spreads all the musts <br>
        There's snakes that do slither<br>
        Hunting for prey <br>
        Hither and thither<br>
        They watch the mice play<br>
        There’s an uneasy fawn<br>
        That races past<br>
        While I see the dawn <br>
        That comes on fast<br>
        The sun comes up<br>
        Quite slowly at first<br>
        Passed a buttercup<br>
        With its petals persed<br>
        There’s deer that are fighting and playing.<br>
        In the meadow behind.<br>
        while their mother is watching and laying.<br>
        to see that they’re kind.<br>
        There's a song sung by the wind.<br>
        And a beat made by the creaking of the wood.<br>
        The birds join and sing their end.<br>
        As the squirrels dance and chase like they should.<br>
        I sit and watch  all this and say, “this is good”<br>
