    <h1>Each second counts</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        As time does fly<br>
        All of us cry <br>
        “Slow down, don't pass us by”<br>
        This backwards plea<br>
        Is wrong you see<br>
        For time is but a currency<br>
        Each second has weight<br>
        Like the coins of fate<br>
        To be spent on love or hate <br>
        We spend forevers<br>
        And promise Nevers<br>
        But leave none for good endeavors<br>
        We spend and spend<br>
        But to no end<br>
        And don't expect life’s sad trend<br>
        We think of time<br>
        And the clock’s chime <br>
        As a path that we must climb<br>
        But this lie <br>
        Is the reason why <br>
        It seems to us that time does fly.<br>
