    <h1>Resistance:</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        Everyone is tempted<br>
        We all feel the pull<br>
        And no one's exempted<br>
        We all have a soul<br>
        It's hard to resist when you want to sin<br>
        It's hard to resist when they give in<br>
        It's hard to resist with the world we're in<br>
        It's hard to resist when you want to sin<br>
        No one said it'd be easy<br>
        Only one man has done it<br>
        When you want to be pleasing<br>
        Watch someone's happiness summit<br>
        You feel what you want is right<br>
        And it gets much harder to fight<br>
        But not so hard<br>
        When they insisted<br>
        In your emotional flood<br>
        You heard in your heart<br>
        “You've not yet resisted<br>
        To the point of shedding blood”<br>
        Shedding blood like he did<br>
        So that all of us were shown<br>
        Shedding blood makes you defeated<br>
        Particularly when it's your own<br>
        But there is forgiveness<br>
        He doesn't insist <br>
        That you always resist<br>
        That's why he sent his son<br>
        He sent him to be the one<br>
        The one to makes us more than works of a potter’s<br>
        To make us adopted, his sons and his daughters<br>

    </p>
