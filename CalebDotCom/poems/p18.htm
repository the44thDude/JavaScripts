    <h1>September Nights:</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        Tonight I'm alone with the embers<br>
        With all my numbed members<br>
        I was embraced tenderly<br>
        And the cold of night<br>
        Has lost the fight<br>
        In my heart<br>
        Cause I'm not falling apart<br>
        Falling like the leaves<br>
        Or the weather <br>
        Or the other people who think they love<br>
        Or the steeples that release doves<br>
        I think today was good for September<br>
        As I watch the wood turn to ember.<br>
        I also think maybe life's taken a toll<br>
        But I say<br>
        That's okay<br>
        As I watch the red hot coal<br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p></p>
