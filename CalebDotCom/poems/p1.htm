    <h1>A greeting to the pilgrim</h1>
    <p>
        <br>
        Welcome to the nothing. <br>
        Welcome to the desert.<br>
        Welcome to this sparse place<br>
        Where your thirst is never quenched<br>
        Where you strive across the land.<br>
        Where you can't walk or move without slipping <br>
        And falling in the sand. <br>
        <br>
        Welcome to the nothing <br>
        Welcome to the sea<br>
        Welcome to this dark place<br>
        Where your breaths are always labored<br>
        Where you strive to never drown<br>
        Where you can't cough or gasp without sinking<br>
        And falling deeper down<br>
        <br>
        Welcome to the nothing <br>
        Welcome to the prison<br>
        Welcome to this hard place<br>
        Where your steps are always numbered<br>
        Where you strive to never break <br>
        Where you can't talk or smile without fighting<br>
        And falling for their sake.<br>
        <br>
        Welcome to the nothing, where everyone talks but nobody speaks<br>
        Welcome to the nothing where everyone looks but nobody sees.<br>
        Welcome to the nothing where everyone hears but nobody listens<br>
        Welcome<br>
        Welcome<br>
        Welcome<br>
        Because the nothing is not all there is.<br>
        There is no desert without mountains, no thirst without water, and no striving without a goal<br>
        There is no sea without islands, no drowning without air, and no striving without hope.<br>
        There is no prison without freedom, no fighting without bravery, and no striving without success.<br>
        So welcome to the nothing because that is where you are.<br>
        but the nothing just means, something isn't very far.<br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p></p>
