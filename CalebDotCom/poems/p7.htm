    <h1>Fighting sin:</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        I have this ringing in my ears <br>
        It goes deeper than appears<br>
        It's more than all my hopes and fears<br>
        It's the yelling of my peers<br>
        Saying I don't deserve these tears<br>
        That I shed for broken years<br>
        But as the ringing grows and nears<br>
        My enemy looks and leers<br>
        It glares, roars and it rears<br>
        And I listen to them cheer<br>
        So I swallow all my jeers<br>
        I know it's not right<br>
        I know I should fight<br>
        And might be up all night<br>
        It has its grip on me tight<br>
        It can't be almost or not quite<br>
        I have to win for the light<br>
        But I know despite<br>
        All of my might<br>
        The only sound my soul hears <br>
        Is the ringing in my ears<br>

    </p>
