    <h1>Lies:    </h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        As the fire dies <br>
        I think of all the lies<br>
        The moments in past<br>
        When I stood and spoke too fast<br>
        When I gave into all my doubts.<br>
        And as the fire sparks and spouts<br>
        I jump and let the words come out<br>
        As the wood burns I and shout <br>
        The things I tried to hide<br>
        What needed to keep inside.<br>
        They're gone.<br>
        It's done<br>
        I'm finished<br>
        Poured out<br>
        There's no longer doubt<br>
        No longer full<br>
        Emptied while embers turn to coal<br>
        
    </p>
    <p></p>
