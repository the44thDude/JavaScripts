        It begins slowly.<br>
        A breath, two eyes opening, a cry, the first of many<br>
        Then it gets faster<br>
        A smile, two feet walking, a word, the first of many.<br>

        A sigh, two eyes meeting, a shared moment, the first of many<br>
        Then it gets faster.,<br>
        A touch, two hands held, an embrace, the first of many.<br>

        A gasp, two hearts beating, a sob, the first of many.<br>
